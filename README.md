# Bitcoin-Key-Generator

A little app with PyQt5 for generate/import Bitcoin private key and generate the public keys (compressed and uncrompressed) and the address (Legacy , P2PKH and P2WPKH)
of it. All the crypto is made with default python librairies exepted the RIPEMD160 hashing function which I was unable to do without a third-party library.
